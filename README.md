A bit about it...
This portfolio is a small Rails CMS. It allows me to upload projects and give them a consistent look.

Recently, I fully changed the front-end. I tried to design a visual look that was simpler yet more effective than the previous version. I used less JavaScript which allows the site to load faster. This change happened over a weekend, since I had very limited time, I quickly designed and implemented the website over the back-end I already had, making only some smaller changes to it.

In the admin, I upload the information that is shown in the 'About' page for each project. It has an option for case studies that I haven't been able to use given the time I had for the project.

xoxo!
